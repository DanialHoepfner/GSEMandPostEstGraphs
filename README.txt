This repository shows some examples of code written to get interactions and predicted probability graphs resulting from GSEM models.
There are two datasets, one for STATA 14 another for those with version 13 (Not sure if it works on earlier versions).
The graphs generated are also included in the event you can't run the models(or activate the stored results) with your version of STATA.
The are two .ster files, which contained the stored results from the GSEM models, one of which takes about a day to run (so results can just be called up instead).
The models and graphs are explained, the do file is heavily annotated.
A draft of the chapter is also included for more detail and additional models/theory/etc.
Datasets used to build the main dataset:  

IMF. World Economic Outlook. IMF, 2015.
